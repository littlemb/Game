Possible Game Features


Zoom in to 1st or 3rd person view when selecting a target to shoot(or some other action)

Classes have specific stats
	ie. Health, Movement(Speed), Accuracy, Armor(some kind of defense?)

Calculate chance to hit
	distance, cover(none, half, full), line of sight(might be too hard), accuracy rating

Animate taking cover on objects if near one

Enemy AI
	because we are advancing on the enemy base, enemies are unaware until soldiers make contact

	default Enemy AI(change this for different difficulties if we need)
		priority

		1) If flanked or out of cover, move to cover
		2) move in range of player's characters if possible, while remaining in cover
		3) attack character with highest % to hit
		4) special abilities (if enemies have these, or they might just get more health and accuracy as the game goes on to make it more difficult)

Universal Character Actions (characters have 2 actions to spend)
	Move		-	1 action (basic move action)
	Run		-	2 actions(2 seperate movements at once, reaction shot has less chance to hit)
	Shoot		-	1 action (if this is done first should it end your turn?)
	Lay Low		-	1 action (ends turn and gives a extra cover bonus)
	Overwatch	-	1 action (end turn and allows a reaction shot)	- this might not be included depending on how hard it is to implement
	Cover		-	2 actions(use 3x ammo of shoot, decreases accuracy and doesn't allow movement of target) - universal or heavy gunner only?
